# Blog with Laravel

This is a ready made blog build with laravel just to make your effort easy. You can setup your blog in just 30 min.

## Getting Started

If you have no idea about Laravel , I would suggest you to check it [here](http://laravel.com/docs/5.4) . You need your system to be ready as per Laravel system requirement.

### Packages in there. 

This has

* [Laravel](http://laravel.com/docs/5.4)5.4
* [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) for  blog template.
* [SB Admin](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/) for the admin panel

### Pre Requirement

In your system Laravel 5.4 installation should be up and runnign well . Else you'll have to spend time on fixing things rather than this blog.
